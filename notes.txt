Advanced todo app idea:
- several tabs for category
- it is possible to add and remove categories
- when removing, ask to remove tasks with that category
  or move them to general category
- task on every category is possible to assign to
  another category (in task edit - dropdown list)

How store is working
- on app load check local storage once.
- on every item added/edited update akita state.
- everytime akita state changes, update local storage

Data structure
id,
value,
category,
complete,
due date

Next things to do with this app:

- split different ways to implement a todo into separate components (modules?)
- see if input field can be made as a generic component and be reused
- add JSON server and interact with it?

- styles: angular-materials, mobile first

- explore more af Akita features:
  * setLoading() ...
